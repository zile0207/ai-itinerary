# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Dashboard Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the dashboard module with itinerary management grid, search functionality, filtering options, and quick actions for creating, duplicating, and sharing itineraries using mock JSON data instead of database connections.
# Details:
1. Design and implement responsive grid layout for itinerary cards
2. Create itinerary card component with thumbnail, destination, dates, and action buttons
3. Implement search functionality with real-time filtering using mock JSON data
4. Add sorting options (by date, alphabetical, recently modified) working with local data
5. Develop quick action buttons (create, duplicate, delete, share) that modify the mock data
6. Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
7. Create empty state for new users
8. Add loading states and skeleton loaders (simulated with timeouts)
9. Implement pagination or infinite scroll for large collections of mock data
10. Add recent activity timeline based on mock activity data

Example component structure:
```typescript
// Dashboard components
const Dashboard = () => {
  const [itineraries, setItineraries] = useState<Itinerary[]>([]);
  const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
  const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState<'date' | 'name' | 'recent'>('recent');
  
  // Load mock itineraries from JSON file
  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate API loading time
    const loadMockData = async () => {
      setLoading(true);
      try {
        // Import mock data from JSON file
        const mockData = await import('../data/mockItineraries.json');
        setItineraries(mockData.default);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error loading mock data:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };
    
    loadMockData();
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div className="dashboard-container">
      <header className="dashboard-header">
        <h1>My Itineraries</h1>
        <button className="create-button">Create New Itinerary</button>
      </header>
      
      <div className="search-filter-container">
        <SearchInput value={searchQuery} onChange={setSearchQuery} />
        <SortOptions value={sortBy} onChange={setSortBy} />
      </div>
      
      <div className="itinerary-grid">
        {itineraries.map(itinerary => (
          <ItineraryCard 
            key={itinerary.id}
            itinerary={itinerary}
            onDuplicate={handleDuplicate}
            onDelete={handleDelete}
            onShare={handleShare}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for search and filter functionality using mock JSON data
2. Component tests for itinerary cards and grid layout
3. Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
4. Verify all quick actions work correctly with mock data operations
5. Test search performance with large mock datasets
6. Validate proper error handling for failed mock data loading
7. Test empty and loading states
8. Verify proper rendering of itinerary thumbnails from mock data
9. Test data persistence between sessions using localStorage if needed
10. Verify that filtering and sorting work correctly with the mock dataset

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Grid Layout and Responsive Design [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a responsive grid layout for the dashboard that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
### Details:
Design and implement a flexible grid system using CSS Grid or Flexbox. Ensure the layout is responsive with breakpoints for mobile (320px-480px), tablet (481px-768px), laptop (769px-1024px), and desktop (1025px+). Include container components that maintain proper spacing and alignment. Implement media queries to adjust the number of columns based on screen width. Ensure consistent margins, padding, and gutters between grid items. Test across multiple devices and browsers for compatibility.

## 2. Develop Itinerary Card Components with Actions [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create reusable itinerary card components with interactive action buttons and consistent styling.
### Details:
Design card components with consistent height/width ratios that fit within the grid layout. Include image containers with proper aspect ratios, title sections, date/time information, and status indicators. Implement action buttons (edit, delete, share, favorite) with hover/focus states. Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions. Ensure cards display truncated content with 'read more' functionality when text exceeds available space. Implement card animations for hover/selection states. Make cards keyboard navigable for accessibility.

## 3. Implement Search, Filter, and Sort Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Add interactive search, filtering, and sorting capabilities to the dashboard using mock JSON data.
### Details:
Create a search input with auto-suggestions and history. Implement filters for categories, dates, status, and favorites with multi-select capabilities. Add sorting options (newest, oldest, alphabetical, popularity). Ensure filter/sort controls are collapsible on mobile. Implement client-side filtering logic with debounced search input using the mock JSON data. Create visual indicators for active filters. Design empty states for no search results. Ensure the grid updates dynamically when search/filter/sort criteria change. Add URL parameter support to make filtered views shareable.

## 4. Add Loading States and Pagination [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Implement loading indicators, pagination controls, and infinite scrolling for the dashboard.
### Details:
Design skeleton loaders that match the card layout dimensions. Implement pagination controls with page numbers, previous/next buttons, and items-per-page selector. Add infinite scrolling as an alternative to traditional pagination. Create smooth transitions between loading and loaded states. Implement scroll position memory when navigating back to the dashboard. Add progress indicators for background operations. Ensure loading states are accessible with proper ARIA attributes. Optimize performance by implementing virtualized lists for large data sets.

## 5. Create Mock JSON Data Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive mock data structure in JSON format to support all dashboard functionality.
### Details:
Create a well-structured JSON file with sample itinerary data. Include at least 20-30 mock itineraries with varied attributes (destinations, dates, durations, images, etc.). Ensure the data structure supports all required filtering and sorting operations. Include metadata like creation dates, modification dates, and user information. Add mock image URLs or base64 encoded thumbnails. Structure the data to simulate real-world usage patterns. Document the schema for other developers. Store the JSON files in a dedicated '/data' directory in the project.

## 6. Implement Mock Data Service Layer [done]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Create a service layer to handle all interactions with the mock JSON data.
### Details:
Develop utility functions to load, filter, sort, and modify the mock data. Implement CRUD operations that work with the local JSON data. Add simulated network delays to mimic real API behavior. Create methods for searching, filtering, and pagination that work with the mock data. Implement data persistence using localStorage if needed. Add error handling for edge cases. Document the service API for other developers. Ensure the service layer could be easily replaced with real API calls in the future.
