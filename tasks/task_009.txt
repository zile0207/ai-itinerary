}

const BudgetTracker = ({ itinerary, travelers }) => {
  const [expenses, setExpenses] = useState<Expense[]>([]);
  const [budget, setBudget] = useState(itinerary.budget);
  const [currency, setCurrency] = useState(itinerary.currency);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Load expenses from API
    fetchExpenses(itinerary.id).then(setExpenses);
  }, [itinerary.id]);
  
  const addExpense = async (expense: Omit<Expense, 'id'>) => {
    try {
      const newExpense = await createExpense(itinerary.id, expense);
      setExpenses(prev => [...prev, newExpense]);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to add expense:', error);
    }
  };
  
  const calculateTotalByCategory = () => {
    return expenses.reduce((acc, expense) => {
      // Convert to selected currency if needed
      const amount = expense.currency !== currency 
        ? convertCurrency(expense.amount, expense.currency, currency)
        : expense.amount;
      
      acc[expense.category] = (acc[expense.category] || 0) + amount;
      return acc;
    }, {} as Record<string, number>);
  };
  
  const calculateTotalExpenses = () => {
    const totals = calculateTotalByCategory();
    return Object.values(totals).reduce((sum, amount) => sum + amount, 0);
  };
  
  const calculateExpensesByPerson = () => {
    return expenses.reduce((acc, expense) => {
      // Calculate split amount
      const splitAmount = expense.amount / expense.splitBetween.length;
      
      // Add paid amount to payer
      acc[expense.paidBy] = acc[expense.paidBy] || { paid: 0, owed: 0 };
      acc[expense.paidBy].paid += expense.amount;
      
      // Add owed amounts to each person
      expense.splitBetween.forEach(personId => {
        acc[personId] = acc[personId] || { paid: 0, owed: 0 };
        acc[personId].owed += splitAmount;
      });
