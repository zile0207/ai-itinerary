# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Prompt Generator Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the multi-step wizard interface for collecting travel parameters, including destination input, date selection, traveler information, preferences, budget, and external content analysis.
# Details:
1. Create multi-step form wizard with progress indicator
2. Implement destination input with natural language processing
3. Build interactive map component for location selection
4. Develop date range picker with flexible options
5. Create traveler composition input (count, ages, relationships)
6. Implement interest and activity preference selection
7. Build budget configuration with currency selection
8. Create URL input for blog/video content analysis
9. Implement form validation and error handling
10. Build summary review screen before submission

Example multi-step form structure:
```typescript
const PromptGenerator = () => {
  const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    destination: '',
    dateRange: { start: null, end: null },
    travelers: [],
    interests: [],
    budget: { amount: 0, currency: 'USD' },
    externalUrls: []
  });
  
  const handleNext = () => setStep(prev => prev + 1);
  const handleBack = () => setStep(prev => prev - 1);
  
  const renderStepContent = () => {
    switch(step) {
      case 1: return <DestinationStep data={formData} updateData={setFormData} />;
      case 2: return <DateStep data={formData} updateData={setFormData} />;
      case 3: return <TravelersStep data={formData} updateData={setFormData} />;
      case 4: return <InterestsStep data={formData} updateData={setFormData} />;
      case 5: return <BudgetStep data={formData} updateData={setFormData} />;
      case 6: return <ExternalContentStep data={formData} updateData={setFormData} />;
      case 7: return <ReviewStep data={formData} onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;
      default: return null;
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="prompt-generator">
      <ProgressIndicator currentStep={step} totalSteps={7} />
      {renderStepContent()}
      <div className="navigation-buttons">
        {step > 1 && <button onClick={handleBack}>Back</button>}
        {step < 7 ? <button onClick={handleNext}>Next</button> : <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Generate Itinerary</button>}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for form validation logic
2. Component tests for each step of the wizard
3. Test form state persistence between steps
4. Verify natural language processing for destination input
5. Test map interaction for location selection
6. Validate URL processing for external content
7. Test error handling for invalid inputs
8. Verify summary screen accurately displays all inputs

# Subtasks:
## 1. Multi-step form architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core architecture for the multi-step form wizard
### Details:
Create the overall structure for the multi-step form including navigation between steps, progress tracking, and global state management. Implement the form container component that will house all steps. Define the step transition logic and persistence of data between steps. Include error handling and form submission architecture.

## 3. Traveler and date inputs [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Build the traveler information and date selection components
### Details:
Create form components for inputting traveler information (number of adults, children, etc.) with appropriate validation. Implement date range picker for trip duration with validation for minimum/maximum stays and invalid date combinations. Add logic to calculate trip duration and store in state. Include conditional fields that appear based on traveler selections. Ensure all inputs are properly validated before allowing progression to next steps.
<info added on 2025-05-26T16:53:08.572Z>
## New Implementation Plan:
1. **TravelersStep**: Custom traveler management
   - Add/remove travelers with individual profiles
   - Each traveler can have tags (allergies, food preferences, activity preferences)
   - Support for different traveler types (adult, child, infant)
   
2. **DatesStep**: Date range selection
   - Use shadcn date picker component
   - Trip duration calculation
   - Validation for reasonable date ranges

This split approach provides better user experience and more detailed traveler information for AI prompt generation. Each step will have its own form validation and will only allow progression when valid. The traveler profiles will capture more nuanced preferences that can be used to generate more personalized trip recommendations.

## Performance Optimization Fix

### Infinite Loop Issue in Destination Selection

**Root Cause:**
- Identified non-memoized `validateStep` function in `DestinationStep.tsx` causing recreation on every render
- Discovered dependency cycle in `useEffect` triggering infinite re-renders
- Found problematic `formData` dependency in `updateFormData` function causing unnecessary re-renders

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **DestinationStep.tsx Fixes:**
   - Memoized `validateStep` function with `useCallback` and proper dependencies
   - Restructured `useEffect` to depend on the memoized function
   - Eliminated circular dependency pattern

2. **PromptGenerator.tsx Fixes:**
   - Removed `formData` from `updateFormData` dependency array
   - Implemented functional state updates to access previous state
   - Restructured callback to prevent recreation on form data changes

**Testing Results:**
- Application builds and runs without compilation errors
- No more "maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- Destination selection now functions properly without performance issues
- Overall form navigation is more stable and responsive

This fix ensures the traveler information and date selection components can operate without being affected by infinite render loops from the destination selection step.

## Final Implementation Status

**Issues Fixed:**
✅ **Infinite Loop Error**: Fixed the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in destination selection
✅ **Unescaped Quotes**: Fixed React linting errors for unescaped quotes in DestinationStep
✅ **Unused Variables**: Cleaned up unused variable warnings in placeholder components
✅ **Build Compilation**: Application builds successfully without compilation errors

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- Removed unused DateStep component (replaced by DatesStep)
- Fixed ESLint warnings in ExternalContentStep and ReviewStep components
- Improved React performance with proper useCallback memoization
- Eliminated circular dependencies in form state management

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Application runs smoothly on localhost:3000
- ✅ All form steps navigate without errors
- ✅ Destination selection works properly
- ✅ No more infinite re-rendering issues
- ✅ Build process completes successfully

**Remaining Linting Issues (Non-Critical):**
- Some unused variables in auth routes (passwordHash)
- Image optimization warnings (can be addressed later)
- Unescaped entities in other components (cosmetic)
- TypeScript 'any' types in error handling (can be refined later)

The traveler information module is now stable and fully integrated with the prompt generator flow, ready for the next development phase.
