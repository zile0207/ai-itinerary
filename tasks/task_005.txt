10. Design system for continuous prompt optimization
11. Implement JSON file storage or in-memory storage for generated itineraries
12. Handle source attribution and citation display
13. Implement real-time data freshness validation

Example prompt engineering:
```typescript
const generateItineraryPrompt = (userData: UserInput): string => {
  return `
Research and create a detailed travel itinerary with up-to-date information for the following parameters:

Destination: ${userData.destination}
Dates: ${formatDateRange(userData.dateRange)}
Travelers: ${formatTravelers(userData.travelers)}
Interests: ${userData.interests.join(', ')}
Budget: ${userData.budget.amount} ${userData.budget.currency}

External content references: ${userData.externalUrls.join('\n')}

Please create a day-by-day itinerary with:
1. Morning, afternoon, and evening activities
2. Estimated costs for each activity
3. Travel time between locations
4. Meal recommendations
5. Accommodation suggestions
6. Current travel conditions or advisories
7. Recent reviews or travel experiences
8. Source citations for recommendations

Format the response as a structured JSON object with the following schema:
${JSON.stringify(ITINERARY_SCHEMA, null, 2)}
`;
};

const generateItinerary = async (userData: UserInput): Promise<Itinerary> => {
  const prompt = generateItineraryPrompt(userData);
  
  try {
    const response = await perplexity.query({
      model: "pplx-7b-online", // or appropriate Perplexity model
      query: prompt,
      max_tokens: 2000,
      temperature: 0.7,
      include_citations: true
    });
    
    const itinerary = parseItineraryResponse(response.text, response.citations);
    // Store the itinerary as a JSON file or in memory
    await storeItinerary(userData.id, itinerary);
    return itinerary;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating itinerary:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to generate itinerary');
  }
};

// Function to store itinerary as JSON file or in memory
const storeItinerary = async (userId: string, itinerary: Itinerary): Promise<void> => {
  // Option 1: Store as JSON file
  const filename = `itinerary_${userId}_${Date.now()}.json`;
  await fs.writeFile(path.join(ITINERARIES_DIR, filename), JSON.stringify(itinerary, null, 2));
  
  // Option 2: Store in memory (e.g., in a Map or other data structure)
  // inMemoryItineraryStore.set(userId, itinerary);
};
```

- Data source type-specific aging rules (pricing: 6h, weather: 3h, events: 12h, etc.)
- Freshness scoring algorithm (0-1 scale) with automatic refresh recommendations
- Cost-aware auto-refresh scheduling with configurable cost thresholds ($0.10 default)

**Validation Features:**
- Multi-component itinerary validation (metadata, pricing, daily activities)
- Citation timestamp extraction for source-based freshness assessment
- Staleness indicator classification (low, medium, high, critical severity)
- Refresh urgency calculation (low, medium, high, immediate)
- Comprehensive validation history tracking (last 10 validations per source)

**API Integration:**
- Built `/api/data-freshness` endpoint with 6 action types:
  - validate-itinerary: Full itinerary freshness assessment
  - validate-data: Individual data source validation
  - check-refresh-needed: Batch refresh status checking
  - get-statistics: Freshness monitoring dashboard
  - schedule-refresh: Auto-refresh management
  - get-refresh-cost: Cost estimation for refresh operations

**Frontend Components:**
- Created `FreshnessIndicator.tsx` with visual freshness scoring
- Color-coded indicators (green: fresh, yellow: aging, red: stale)
- Expandable details showing issues, recommendations, and next validation
- Refresh button integration with cost-aware scheduling
- Real-time freshness score visualization with progress bars

**Integration Points:**
- Integrated with itinerary generation API for automatic freshness validation
- Response includes freshness metadata in API responses
- Citation manager integration for source timestamp extraction
- Storage system compatibility for persistent freshness tracking

**Monitoring & Analytics:**
- Comprehensive freshness statistics (total/fresh/stale/critical sources)
- Oldest source tracking and refresh candidate identification
- Average freshness scoring across all data sources
- Actionable insights generation with automated recommendations

**Build Status:** ✅ All components compile successfully with no blocking errors
