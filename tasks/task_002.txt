# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Authentication System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the frontend components for the authentication system, integrating with the existing backend authentication services that include user registration, login, password reset, and session management.
# Details:
The backend authentication system is already implemented with:

- Mock user data structure (src/lib/mock-data/users.ts)
- JWT authentication implementation (src/lib/auth.ts)
- Login/register API endpoints (/api/auth/login, /api/auth/register, /api/auth/me)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected route middleware

This task focuses on implementing the frontend components:

1. Create authentication context and hooks for managing auth state
2. Develop login and registration forms with validation
3. Implement protected route components to restrict access
4. Build user profile and settings pages
5. Set up OAuth integration for Google and Facebook login (frontend only)
6. Implement proper error handling and validation
7. Create responsive UI components for all authentication flows

Example code for authentication context:
```typescript
// Auth context structure
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  register: (userData: RegisterData) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
  updateProfile: (data: Partial<User>) => Promise<void>;
}

// Auth provider component
const AuthProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  
  // Implementation details...
  
  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, isAuthenticated: !!user, isLoading, login, register, logout, updateProfile }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for authentication hooks and context
2. Component tests for login, registration, and profile forms
3. Integration tests for authentication flows in the UI
4. Test protected routes functionality
5. Verify OAuth frontend integration
6. Test form validation and error handling
7. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
8. End-to-end tests for complete authentication flows
