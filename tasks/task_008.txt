      // Add user to active users
      if (!activeUsers.has(itineraryId)) {
        activeUsers.set(itineraryId, new Map());
      }
      activeUsers.get(itineraryId).set(socket.id, {

The Operational Transformation (OT) engine has been successfully implemented with all core components completed. The implementation includes a comprehensive type system in `src/lib/ot/types.ts` with various operation types (TextInsertOp, TextDeleteOp, TextReplaceOp, ObjectSetOp, ObjectDeleteOp, ArrayInsertOp, ArrayDeleteOp, ArrayMoveOp, CompositeOp), document state management with versioning, and priority-based conflict resolution strategies.

The core OT engine in `src/lib/ot/core.ts` features a transform algorithm that handles concurrent operations, text operations with position adjustments, array operations with index-aware transformations, object operations with key-based conflict resolution, safe operation application with rollback capability, and operation composition with undo/redo support.

Utility functions in `src/lib/ot/utils.ts` provide JSON path manipulation, operation utilities, text and array manipulation, and validation capabilities. The document manager in `src/lib/ot/documentManager.ts` implements real-time coordination, optimistic updates, conflict resolution, a complete undo/redo system, and connection management for online/offline states.

Socket.io integration has been completed with events for operations, acknowledgments, rejections, and undo/redo functionality, all properly scoped to trip-based collaboration rooms with comprehensive error handling.

The implementation successfully delivers intention preservation, convergence guarantees, causality preservation, undo/redo support, optimistic updates, configurable conflict resolution strategies, and full TypeScript support. The OT engine is now ready for integration into collaborative editing components for itinerary data.

Add a real-time synchronization layer that integrates the operational transformation (OT) engine with React components for collaborative editing. Implement a `useCollaborativeDocument` hook to manage real-time document state, leveraging the OT system's DocumentManager and handling Socket.io events for operation broadcasting and reception. Ensure optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution mechanisms. Develop collaborative editing components, including real-time text inputs, form fields, and rich text editors, all wired to the OT system for seamless multi-user editing. Incorporate synchronization status indicators, conflict resolution UIs, and offline mode support. Modify existing itinerary editing components to utilize these collaborative hooks, enabling real-time sync for trip details, activities, and accommodations, and implement field-level locking during editing to prevent conflicts. Use TypeScript interfaces for all collaborative data structures and ensure integration with the user presence system for live editing indicators. This synchronization foundation is required before implementing the comment system.

## Implementation Steps for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Step 1: Analyze Current Environment
- Identify key organizational resources and classify them based on criticality
- Conduct detailed assessment of procedures and workflows
- Evaluate how users access and interact with resources
- Review existing security procedures, policies, and systems
- Assess current user grouping and account provisioning/de-provisioning

### Step 2: Define Roles and Map Permissions
- Analyze organizational structure to segment roles based on access levels
- Identify missing roles that need to be created
- Map specific permissions to each role
- Consider special conditions (temporary access, additional access, conflicting roles)
- Group roles with similar access requirements to streamline assignment

### Step 3: Implement RBAC System
- Define app roles for the application
- Assign users or groups to appropriate roles
- Create systematic, repeatable assignment of permissions
- Implement role-permission relationships to simplify user management
- Follow principle of least privilege (assign fewest permissions needed)

### Step 4: Integrate RBAC with Application
- Implement permission checking throughout the application
- Create role-based UI components that adapt based on user permissions
- Ensure real-time updates when permissions change
- Set up audit capabilities to track user privileges
- Implement mechanisms to quickly add/change roles across APIs

### Step 5: Test and Validate
- Verify correct permission enforcement for all roles
- Test edge cases including permission conflicts
- Validate time-based access controls function properly
- Ensure permission inheritance hierarchies work as expected
- Confirm real-time propagation of permission changes
