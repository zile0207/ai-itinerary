# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn. Set up the Next.js API routes with mock data instead of database connections.
# Details:
1. Create a new Git repository
2. Initialize frontend with Create React App or Next.js with TypeScript
3. Install and configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn UI components
4. Set up Next.js API routes with mock data
5. Create mock data files for users, itineraries, activities, etc.
6. Implement basic project structure with directories for components, services, hooks, etc.
7. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
8. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
9. Create development, staging, and production environments

Code structure example:
```typescript
// Project structure
/src
  /components
  /hooks
  /services
  /pages
  /styles
  /app
    /api
      /routes
  /mocks
    /data
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all dependencies install correctly
2. Ensure TypeScript compilation works without errors
3. Test basic API endpoints with mock data
4. Verify frontend builds and renders correctly
5. Run linting and formatting checks
6. Test CI/CD pipeline with a sample commit

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup API Routes and Backend Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Next.js API routes structure with mock data for the application
### Details:
1. Create API routes in src/app/api/ directory
2. Set up authentication endpoints (/api/auth) with mock responses
3. Create mock data utilities and JSON files
4. Set up middleware for CORS, authentication, etc.
5. Create basic health check endpoint

API Routes Implementation Complete!

Successfully implemented:
1. ✅ Health check endpoint (/api/health)
2. ✅ Authentication endpoints:
   - POST /api/auth/login - Login with mock users
   - POST /api/auth/register - Register new users
   - GET /api/auth/me - Get current user profile (protected)
3. ✅ Itinerary endpoints:
   - GET /api/itineraries - List user's itineraries with search/filter
   - POST /api/itineraries - Create new itinerary
   - GET /api/itineraries/[id] - Get specific itinerary
   - PUT /api/itineraries/[id] - Update itinerary
   - DELETE /api/itineraries/[id] - Delete itinerary
4. ✅ Mock data structures:
   - User data with authentication (src/lib/mock-data/users.ts)
   - Itinerary data with activities (src/lib/mock-data/itineraries.ts)
5. ✅ Authentication utilities:
   - JWT token generation/verification
   - Request authentication middleware
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
6. ✅ Proper TypeScript types for all data structures
7. ✅ Error handling and validation
8. ✅ Protected routes with user ownership checks

Demo users available:
- john.doe@example.com / password123
- jane.smith@example.com / password123  
- demo@example.com / password123

All endpoints tested and working with proper authentication flow.

## 4. Create Mock Data Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop mock data files to simulate backend responses without database
### Details:
1. Create JSON files for mock user data
2. Develop mock itineraries and activities data
3. Set up helper functions to query mock data
4. Implement simulated delays for realistic API behavior
5. Create documentation for mock data structure

## 3. Environment Configuration and Security [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up environment variables, security configurations, and deployment settings
### Details:
1. Create .env.local and .env.example files
2. Configure environment variables for API keys (OpenAI, Google Maps)
3. Set up CORS and security headers
4. Configure authentication secrets and JWT settings
5. Set up different environments (dev, staging, prod)
<info added on 2025-05-26T06:05:48.409Z>
✅ Environment Configuration Complete!

Successfully implemented:
1. ✅ Configuration management system (src/lib/config.ts)
   - Centralized environment variable handling
   - API key management for OpenAI, Google Maps, OAuth
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Configuration validation with warnings/errors

2. ✅ Security headers in Next.js config:
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin
   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

3. ✅ CORS middleware (src/middleware.ts):
   - Proper CORS headers for API routes
   - Preflight request handling
   - Security-focused configuration

4. ✅ Image domain configuration:
   - Unsplash for mock images
   - Google/Facebook for profile images

5. ✅ JWT configuration:
   - Centralized secret management
   - Configurable expiration times
   - Production security warnings

6. ✅ API testing verified:
   - Health endpoint: ✅ Working
   - Authentication: ✅ Working
   - Mock data integration: ✅ Working

Environment variables documented in MANUAL_INPUTS_NEEDED.txt for later configuration.
All features work with mock data until API keys are provided.
