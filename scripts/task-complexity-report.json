      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Architecture",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into 5 logical subtasks focusing on frontend setup, backend setup, database configuration, DevOps pipeline, and documentation. For each subtask, include specific deliverables, acceptance criteria, and estimated effort.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up multiple technologies (React/TypeScript/Tailwind/shadcn, Node/Express, PostgreSQL, Redis) across frontend, backend, and database layers. It also includes CI/CD configuration and environment setup, making it moderately complex with interdependent components."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the authentication system implementation into 6 subtasks covering user model/database, JWT implementation, registration/verification flow, login functionality, OAuth integration, and frontend components. Include security considerations and testing requirements for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication is security-critical with multiple flows (email/password, social login, password reset, 2FA) and requires careful implementation of JWT, secure token handling, and rate limiting. The complexity is high due to security implications and the need for thorough testing."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Dashboard Module",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the dashboard module into 4 subtasks: grid layout and responsive design, itinerary card components with actions, search/filter/sort functionality, and loading states/pagination. For each subtask, specify UI/UX requirements and component interactions.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves frontend development with search functionality, responsive grid layouts, and action buttons. While it has multiple UI components, the complexity is moderate as it's primarily focused on frontend presentation and doesn't involve complex business logic or integrations."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Build Prompt Generator Module",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the prompt generator module into 5 subtasks: multi-step form architecture, destination/map integration, traveler and date inputs, preferences/budget configuration, and external content analysis. Include state management and validation requirements for each step.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires building a complex multi-step wizard with various input types, map integration, and natural language processing. The state management across steps and validation logic adds complexity, as does the external content analysis feature."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the OpenAI integration into 6 subtasks: API integration and security, prompt engineering, context formatting, response parsing, error handling/retries, and optimization/caching. For each subtask, include performance considerations and testing strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex AI integration with sophisticated prompt engineering, structured output parsing, and error handling. The need for optimization, caching, and rate limiting adds significant complexity, as does the requirement for continuous prompt improvement."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the itinerary builder into 7 subtasks: Google Maps integration, timeline view implementation, Kanban view implementation, drag-and-drop functionality, activity card components, route visualization, and optimization suggestions. Include technical approach and component interactions for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines complex UI interactions (drag-and-drop), multiple view types (timeline/Kanban), map integration, and route visualization. The interactive nature and need to maintain state consistency across different views makes this highly complex."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the AI chat assistant implementation into 5 subtasks: chat interface components, context-aware AI integration, recommendation engine, external content analysis, and response formatting/error handling. Include conversation state management and performance considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires sophisticated AI integration with context awareness, external content analysis, and structured response formatting. The real-time nature of chat and need to maintain conversation context adds complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Real-time Collaboration Features",
      "complexityScore": 10,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the real-time collaboration system into 8 subtasks: Socket.io setup, user presence tracking, operational transformation, commenting system, version history, rollback functionality, permissions management, and notification system. Include conflict resolution strategies and performance considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task due to real-time synchronization requirements, conflict resolution, operational transformation, and version history tracking. Managing concurrent edits and ensuring data consistency across multiple users requires sophisticated implementation."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the trip management tools into 6 subtasks: flight tracking integration, accommodation management, budget tracking system, traveler profiles, notification system, and checklist functionality. Include data models and integration requirements for each component.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple integrated components with external API dependencies (flight tracking), complex calculations (budget tracking, expense splitting), and currency conversion. The breadth of functionality and need for data consistency across components increases complexity."
